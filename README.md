# Database-Systems-Design-Project
A repo for holding some files on a database design group project from my Database System class at UTSA from Fall 2024.

Maybe not the best use for a GitHub repo, but I find it convienent. Credit to Anthony David Sparks, and Azaan Ezra Sundrani.

As part of my Database Systems class at UTSA from Fall 2024, myself and a couple others listed above were made to work on a project which would see us create a database system. At first, we thought that we had to actually create and program an actual database system, but it turned out that we just had to simply design one, not actually create an entire application. Would have been nice to know from the get go, but I digress. All things considered, I enjoyed figuring out how to design a database system, despite the aforementioned frustration, and I doubt I would mind working on one again in the future.

Anyways, including in this repo are some sql files we came up with, and a document detailing what we had designed, what we intended the database for, and providing some diagrams for reference to better understand the database.
